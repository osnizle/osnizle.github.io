      Cloudsight actually takes longer than most other image recognition
      AIs, according to https://www.topbots.com/chihuahua-muffin-searching-best-computer-vision-api/.
      It takes, on average, about 13 seconds longer than Google's Cloud Vision
      and 12 seconds faster than Microsoft Computer Vision. Cloudsight also just returns
      a phrase, which can be useful in certain situations, but "tags" are better
      in some cases. In addition, Google's AI returns 9 "tags" on average, while Microsoft's
      AI returns 2 less, according to the website seen above.
